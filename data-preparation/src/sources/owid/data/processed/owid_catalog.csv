Data are expressed in terms of area harvested, production quantity and yield. Cereals: Area and production data on cereals relate to crops harvested for dry grain only. Cereal crops harvested for hay or harvested green for food, feed or silage or used for grazing are therefore excluded. 2) CROPS PROCESSED: Beer of barley; Cotton lint; Cottonseed; Margarine, short; Molasses; Oil, coconut (copra); Oil, cottonseed; Oil, groundnut; Oil, linseed; Oil, maize; Oil, olive, virgin; Oil, palm; Oil, palm kernel; Oil, rapeseed; Oil, safflower; Oil, sesame; Oil, soybean; Oil, sunflower; Palm kernels; Sugar Raw Centrifugal; Wine. 3) LIVE ANIMALS: Animals live n.e.s.; Asses; Beehives; Buffaloes; Camelids, other; Camels; Cattle; Chickens; Ducks; Geese and guinea fowls; Goats; Horses; Mules; Pigeons, other birds; Pigs; Rabbits and hares; Rodents, other; Sheep; Turkeys. 4) LIVESTOCK PRIMARY: Beeswax; Eggs (various types);  Hides buffalo, fresh; Hides, cattle, fresh; Honey, natural; Meat (ass, bird nes, buffalo, camel, cattle, chicken, duck,  game, goat, goose and guinea fowl, horse, mule, Meat nes, meat other camelids, Meat other rodents, pig, rabbit, sheep, turkey); Milk (buffalo, camel, cow, goat, sheep); Offals, nes; Silk-worm cocoons, reelable; Skins (goat, sheep); Snails, not sea; Wool, greasy. 5) LIVESTOCK PROCESSED: Butter (of milk from sheep, goat, buffalo, cow); Cheese (of milk from goat, buffalo, sheep, cow milk); Cheese of skimmed cow milk; Cream fresh; Ghee (cow and buffalo milk); Lard; Milk (dry buttermilk,  skimmed condensed, skimmed cow, skimmed dried, skimmed evaporated, whole condensed, whole dried, whole evaporated); Silk raw; Tallow; Whey (condensed and dry); Yoghurt

Processing of possible data anomalies by Our World in Data:

+The area harvested of spinach for China (which refers to mainland) in 1984 is missing. This causes that other regions that are aggregates which include China mainland have a spurious reduction in area harvested of spinach in that year, and a spurious increase in yield. Therefore, we remove those spurious aggregate values.

+The amount of eggs produced per bird for Northern Europe (FAO) is unreasonably high before 1973, with values between 50kg and 115kg, while from 1973 on it has more reasonable values, below 20kg. Therefore, we remove all values for Northern Europe (FAO) between 1961 and 1972.

+Tea production in FAO data increased dramatically from 1990 to 1991 for many different countries (including some of the main producers, like China and India). However, data from 1991 was flagged as 'Estimated value' (while data prior to 1991 is flagged as 'Official figure'). This potentially anomalous increase was not present in the previous version of the data. Therefore, we removed tea production data (as well as per-capita production and yield) from 1991 onwards.

FAO does not provide data for the total number of slaughtered animals to produce meat. We calculate this metric by adding up the number of slaughtered animals of all meat groups. However, when data for slaughtered poultry (which usually outnumbers other meat groups) is not provided, we do not calculate the total (to avoid spurious dips in the data).",http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QCL,https://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/Production_Crops_Livestock_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip,,2023-02-22,2022-12-15,2022.0,Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,,

Primary energy in exajoules (EJ) has been converted to TWh by Our World in Data based on a conversion factor of 1,000,000 / 3,600 (~277.778).

For non-fossil based electricity sources (nuclear, hydro, wind, solar, geothermal, biomass in power, and other renewable sources), BP's generation (in TWh) corresponds to gross generation and not accounting for cross-border electricity supply.
Also, for non-fossil based electricity, there are two ways to define primary energy:
* One is ""direct primary energy"", which corresponds to the electricity generation (in TWh).
* The other is ""input-equivalent primary energy"" (also called ""primary energy using the substitution method"").
  This is the amount of fuel that would be required by thermal power stations to generate the reported electricity, as explained in <a href=""https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/energy-economics/statistical-review/bp-stats-review-2022-methodology.pdf"">BP's methodology document</a>. For example, if a country's nuclear power generated 100 TWh of electricity, and assuming that the efficiency of a standard thermal power plant is 38%, the input equivalent primary energy for this country would be 100 TWh / 0.38 = 263 TWh = 0.95 EJ. This input-equivalent primary energy takes account of the inefficiencies in fossil fuel production and provides a better approximation of each source's share of ""final energy"" consumption.

Additional metrics have been calculated by Our World in Data:
- Annual change in energy consumption by source: this is calculated as the difference from the previous year.
- % of total primary energy: calculated as each source's share of primary energy (direct energy and primary energy using the substitution method) from all sources.
- Per capita energy by source: calculated as primary energy consumption by source, divided by population.

Per capita figures have been calculated using a population dataset that is built and maintained by Our World in Data, based on <a href=""https://ourworldindata.org/population-sources"">different sources</a>.

The file organization follows internal practices and is not particularly user-friendly, but all publicly-available HMD data are included in this set.For users who only want information of a given kind for all countries, the files ""By statistic"" are recommended. In this case the file organization is simpler, but only certain parts of the database (i.e., items labeled ""Complete Data Series"" on country pages) are available in this format.

The present version (2.0) benefited from the partnership with the Joint Research Centre in the Centre of Expertise on Population and Migration (CEPAM). On top of the assumptions about future trends in fertility, mortality, and education, the projections study the effect of several migration assumptions applied to the context of the set of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) scenarios related to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

The new version also includes the reconstruction of population by levels of educational attainment from 1950 to 2015 for 185 countries. More information in Speringer et al. 2019 (https://www.oeaw.ac.at/fileadmin/subsites/Institute/VID/IMG/Publications/Working_Papers/WP2019_02.pdf).

Dataset description by Jones et al. (2023):
A dataset describing the global warming response to national emissions CO2, CH4 and N2O from fossil and land use sources during 1851-2021.

National CO2 emissions data are collated from the Global Carbon Project (Andrew and Peters, 2022; Friedlingstein et al., 2022). 

National CH4 and N2O emissions data are collated from PRIMAP-hist (HISTTP) (Gütschow et al., 2022).

We construct a time series of cumulative CO2-equivalent emissions for each country, gas, and emissions source (fossil or land use). Emissions of CH4 and N2O emissions are related to cumulative CO2-equivalent emissions using the Global Warming Potential (GWP*) approach, with best-estimates of the coefficients taken from the IPCC AR6 (Forster et al., 2021).

Warming in response to cumulative CO2-equivalent emissions is estimated using the transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions (TCRE) approach, with best-estimate value of TCRE taken from the IPCC AR6 (Forster et al., 2021, Canadell et al., 2021). 'Warming' is specifically the change in global mean surface temperature (GMST).

The data files provide emissions, cumulative emissions and the GMST response by country, gas (CO2, CH4, N2O or 3-GHG total) and source (fossil emissions, land use emissions or the total).

We rely on Ember as the primary source of electricity consumption data. While BP provides primary energy (not just electricity) consumption data and it provides a longer time-series (dating back to 1965) than Ember (which only dates back to 1990), BP does not provide data for all countries or for all sources of electricity (for example, only Ember provides data on electricity from bioenergy). So, where data from Ember is available for a given country and year, we rely on it as the primary source. We then supplement this with data from BP where data from Ember is not available.

Our World in Data has converted absolute electricity production by source to the share in the mix by dividing each by total electricity production.

BP's region definitions sometimes differ from Our World in Data's definitions. For example, BP's North America includes only Canada, Mexico and United States, whereas Our World in Data's North America includes countries in Central America (see a map with <a href=""https://ourworldindata.org/world-region-map-definitions"">our region definitions</a>).

Ember compile their global dataset from various sources including:
- Eurostat: Annual European generation and import data, and monthly data in some cases where better sources are not available.
- ENTSO-E: Monthly European generation and import data.
- EIA: Annual global generation and import data.
- UN: Monthly global generation data in some cases.
- GEM: Annual global coal and gas capacity data.
- IRENA: Annual global capacity data for all non-fossil fuel types, and for Other Fossil where available.

We rely on Ember as the primary source of electricity consumption data. While BP provides primary energy (not just electricity) consumption data and it provides a longer time-series (dating back to 1965) than Ember (which only dates back to 1990), BP does not provide data for all countries or for all sources of electricity (for example, only Ember provides data on electricity from bioenergy). So, where data from Ember is available for a given country and year, we rely on it as the primary source. We then supplement this with data from BP where data from Ember is not available.

Our World in Data has converted absolute electricity production by source to the share in the mix by dividing each by total electricity production.

BP's region definitions sometimes differ from Our World in Data's definitions. For example, BP's North America includes only Canada, Mexico and United States, whereas Our World in Data's North America includes countries in Central America (see a map with <a href=""https://ourworldindata.org/world-region-map-definitions"">our region definitions</a>). For this reason, we include in the dataset regions like ""North America (BP)"" to refer to BP's original data using their definition of the region, as well as ""North America"", which is data aggregated by Our World in Data using our definition. These aggregates are constructed by adding up (when possible) the contributions from the countries in the region.

For a full list of source information (i.e., HMD or WMD) country by country, see: https://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid#source-information-country-by-country.

We calculate P-scores using the reported deaths data from HMD and WMD and the projected deaths for 2020–2022 from WMD (which we use for all countries and regions, including for deaths broken down by age group). The P-score is the percentage difference between the reported number of weekly or monthly deaths in 2020–2022 and the projected number of deaths for the same period based on previous years.

We calculate the number of weekly deaths for the United Kingdom by summing the weekly deaths from England & Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.

+The area harvested of spinach for China (which refers to mainland) in 1984 is missing. This causes that other regions that are aggregates which include China mainland have a spurious reduction in area harvested of spinach in that year, and a spurious increase in yield. Therefore, we remove those spurious aggregate values.

+The amount of eggs produced per bird for Northern Europe (FAO) is unreasonably high before 1973, with values between 50kg and 115kg, while from 1973 on it has more reasonable values, below 20kg. Therefore, we remove all values for Northern Europe (FAO) between 1961 and 1972.

+Tea production in FAO data increased dramatically from 1990 to 1991 for many different countries (including some of the main producers, like China and India). However, data from 1991 was flagged as 'Estimated value' (while data prior to 1991 is flagged as 'Official figure'). This potentially anomalous increase was not present in the previous version of the data. Therefore, we removed tea production data (as well as per-capita production and yield) from 1991 onwards.

FAO does not provide data for the total number of slaughtered animals to produce meat. We calculate this metric by adding up the number of slaughtered animals of all meat groups.

For the first chunk, several sources were used. You can learn more at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hkLbEilJbl630IG68q-aQJlUjuTFm9b_12nQMVd1sZM/edit#gid=0.

For the second chunk, Gapminder uses UN population data between 1950 to 2100 from the UN Population Division World Population Prospects 2019, and the forecast to the year 2100 uses their medium-fertility variant. For years before 1950, this version uses the data documented in greater detail by Mattias Lindgren in version 3. The main source was Angus Maddison’s data, which CLIO Infra Project maintained and improved.

Note that when combining version 3 with the new UN data, the trends for a few countries didn't match up in the overlapping year 1950. Minor adjustments were made to the years before and after to smooth out discrepancies between the two sources and avoid spurious jumps in Gapminder's visualisations.

The survey involved more than 140,000 people in 144 countries in 2018, and was run as part of the Gallup World Poll.  Typically, 1,000 individuals were surveyed in each country. In China, India and Russia the sample sizes were 2,000 or greater. In rare instances, the sample size fell between 500 and 1,000.

The survey will provide evidence on how public attitudes vary across different demographic groups and countries, and will help researchers and policy makers around the world to promote debate, and frame proposals for action to improve engagement and trust in science and healthcare.

Further information about the survey can be found on the Wellcome Global Monitor website (https://wellcome.org/reports/wellcome-global-monitor/2018).

For the second edition (July 2019), updated versions of the data and documentation are provided.


MAIN TOPICS
The survey included the following variables:

The survey involved more than 140,000 people in 144 countries in 2018, and was run as part of the Gallup World Poll.  Typically, 1,000 individuals were surveyed in each country. In China, India and Russia the sample sizes were 2,000 or greater. In rare instances, the sample size fell between 500 and 1,000.

The survey will provide evidence on how public attitudes vary across different demographic groups and countries, and will help researchers and policy makers around the world to promote debate, and frame proposals for action to improve engagement and trust in science and healthcare.

Further information about the survey can be found on the Wellcome Global Monitor website (https://wellcome.org/reports/wellcome-global-monitor/2018).

For the second edition (July 2019), updated versions of the data and documentation are provided.

In 2020, the Global Monitor's central focus was science's role in mental health.

The datasets and crosstabs cover the mental health sections of the WGM Survey 2020 conducted in 113 countries and territories worldwide on mental health views and experiences. The rest of the survey data will be published in subsequent data releases.

105,oecd,regional_wellbeing,"Regional Well-Being (OECD, 2016)","The Regional well-being dataset presents eleven dimensions central for well-being at local level and for 395 OECD regions, covering material conditions (income, jobs and housing), quality of life (education, health, environment, safety and access to services) and subjective well-being (social network support and life satisfaction). The set of indicators selected to measure these dimensions is a combination of people's individual attributes and their local conditions, and in most cases, are available over two different years (2000 and 2014). Regions can be easily visualised and compared to other regions through the interactive website [www.oecdregionalwellbeing.org]. The dataset, the website and the publications ""Regions at a Glance"" and ""How’s life in your region?"" are outputs designed from the framework for regional and local well-being.

The Regional income distribution dataset presents comparable data on sub-national differences in income inequality and poverty for OECD countries. The data by region provide information on income distribution within regions (Gini coefficients and income quintiles), and relative income poverty (with poverty thresholds set in respect of the national population) for 2013. These new data complement international assessments of differences across regions in living conditions by documenting how household income is distributed within regions and how many people are poor relatively to the typical citizen of their country.

For analytical purposes, the OECD classifies regions as the first administrative tier of sub-national government, so called Territorial Level 2 or TL2 in the OECD classification. This classification is used by National Statistical Offices to collect information and it represents in many countries the framework for implementing regional policies. Well-being indicators are shown for the 395 TL2 OECD regions, equivalent of the NUTS2 for European countries, with the exception for Estonian where well-being data are presented at a smaller (TL3) level and for the Regional Income dataset, where Greece, Hungary and Poland data are presented at a more aggregated (NUTS1) level.

191,ophi,multidimensional_poverty_index,"Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) (OPHI, 2022)","The global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) is an international measure of acute multidimensional poverty covering over 100 developing countries. It complements traditional monetary poverty measures by capturing the acute deprivations in health, education, and living standards that a person faces simultaneously.

<h4>How is multidimensional poverty defined?</h4>
Being ‘MPI poor’ means that a person is deprived in a third or more of ten indicators, grouped into three dimensions:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Health</strong> – using two indicators: nutrition, child mortality
    <li><strong>Education</strong> – using two indicators: years of schooling, school attendance
    <li><strong>Living standards</strong> – using five indicators: cooking fuel, sanitation, drinking water, electricity, housing, assets.</li>
</ul>
Households are assessed as being deprived in a given indicator if they do not meet a certain threshold for that indicator. For instance, a household is deprived in the <em>Years of schooling</em> indicator if no household member has completed six years of schooling. A person is considered deprived in the <em>Cooking fuel</em> indicator if they cook using solid fuel, such as dung, agricultural crops, wood, charcoal, or coal. The thresholds for each indicator are published by OPHI in their <a href=""https://www.ophi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/OPHI_MPI_MN_54_2022.pdf"">methodological notes</a>.

The individual indicators are not ‘weighted’ equally: When adding up the number of indicators in which a person is deprived, some count for more than others. Health and education indicators are given a weight of 1/6, while the indicators within the living standards dimension are given a weight of 1/18. This means that the three dimensions – health, education and living standards – have an equal weight in the total of one-third each.

If the household survey data being used is missing any of the 10 indicators, that indicator is dropped from the calculation. The weights are then adjusted so that each dimension continues to be given a weight of one-third. MPI poverty estimates are only calculated if at least one indicator in each dimension is available.

The global MPI was developed by OPHI with the UN Development Programme (UNDP) for inclusion in UNDP’s flagship Human Development Report in 2010. It has been published annually by OPHI and in the HDRs ever since.

203,rff,emissions_weighted_carbon_price,Emissions-weighted carbon price,"The World Carbon Pricing Database covers national and subnational economic mechanisms relating to carbon emissions from 1990 onwards. It was developed from several key sources: most notably, policy documents from countries and regions themselves. Secondly, from other sources such as the International Carbon Action Partnership.

The dataset primarily focuses on economic instruments targeting carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. In some cases these instruments also cover other greenhouse gases. However, any pricing mechanisms that target non-CO2 gases (such as methane or nitrous oxide) specifically, are not included.

A country is considered to have a carbon tax or emissions trading system if at least one IPCC sector or gas is covered by the instrument. These instruments do not need to cover all sectors within the economy for this to apply.

For each country, researchers calculate an emissions-weighted carbon price for the economy. To do this, they rely on two metrics:

- Carbon prices applied at the sectoral level (e.g. electricity, or road transport)
- Each sector’s contribution to a country’s CO2 emissions (e.g. what percentage of a country’s emissions come from electricity, or road transport)
They then weight each sector’s carbon price by the relevant sector’s contribution to CO2 emissions, and aggregate these figures to get an economy-wide weighted carbon price.

A full technical note on this methodology is provided by the authors <a href=""https://www.rff.org/publications/working-papers/emissions-weighted-carbon-price-sources-and-methods/"">here</a>.

231,wb,wb_income,World Bank list of economies - World Bank (July 2021),"This table classifies all World Bank member countries (189), and all other economies with populations of more than 30,000. For operational and analytical purposes, economies are divided among income groups according to 2020 gross national income (GNI) per capita, calculated using the World Bank Atlas method. The groups are: low income, $1,045 or less; lower middle income, $1,046  to $4,095; upper middle income, $4,096 to $12,695; and high income, $12,696 or more.The effective operational cutoff for IDA eligibility is $1,205 or less.

Geographic classifications in this table cover all income levels.

IDA countries are those that lack the financial ability to borrow from IBRD. IDA credits are deeply concessional—interest-free loans and grants for programs aimed at boosting economic growth and improving living conditions. IBRD loans are noncessional. Blend countries are eligible for IDA credits because of their low per capita incomes but are also eligible for IBRD because they are financially creditworthy.

Note: The term country, used interchangeably with economy, does not imply political independence but refers to any territory for which authorities report separate social or economic statistics. Income classifications set on 1 July 2021 remain in effect until 1 July 2022. Venezuela has been temporarily unclassified in July 2021 pending release of revised national accounts statistics. Argentina, which was temporarily unclassified in July 2016 pending release of revised national accounts statistics, was classified as upper middle income for FY17 as of 29 September 2016 based on alternative conversion factors. Also effective 29 September 2016, Syrian Arab Republic is reclassified from IBRD lending category to IDA-only. On 29 March 2017, new country codes were introduced to align World Bank 3-letter codes with ISO 3-letter codes: Andorra (AND), Dem. Rep. Congo (COD), Isle of Man (IMN), Kosovo (XKX), Romania (ROU), Timor-Leste (TLS), and West Bank and Gaza (PSE).","[{'name': 'CC BY 4.0', 'url': 'https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/legal/terms-of-use-for-datasets'}]",True,,2021-07-01,96c678ac4a769ce41f56588d82e77b4c,World Bank,,https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups,http://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/site-content/CLASS.xlsx,https://walden.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/wb/2021-07-01/wb_income.xlsx,2021-11-30,2021-07-01,2021.0,,,

241,wid,world_inequality_database,"World Inequality Database (WID, 2023)","The World Inequality Database (WID) is an extensive database on the distribution of income and wealth, both between and within countries. It is primarily maintained by the World Inequality Lab (WIL), located at the Paris School of Economics (PSE). But it is fundamentally the result of a coordinated, collaborative effort involving hundreds of researchers throughout the world over the past twenty years.

In recent years, the WIL has been leading efforts in creating “distributional national accounts” (DINA). The goal is to provide estimates of the distribution of income and wealth that are harmonized over time and across countries, that are consistent with the macroeconomic aggregates produced by national statistical institutes, and that can therefore be viewed as a distributional extension of the existing international System of National Accounts (SNA).

The WID provides extensive data on the distribution of pretax income, post-tax income and wealth, on top of a detailed decomposition of macroeconomic aggregates of income and wealth. This dataset uploaded to Our World in Data contains pretax income data only.

WID seeks to distribute the entirety of national income among resident households (including all income flowing to corporations, the government, and to and from the foreign sector). In this way it accounts for 100% of macroeconomic growth coming from GDP statistics. WID also presents results for numerous concepts across granular percentile groups reaching small fractiles at the very top of the distribution.

WID CONVENTIONS
Unit of observation

“Equal-split adults” series, which distribute income to all adult individuals (over 20 years old), while splitting income equally within a couple or a household. It is the benchmark series to deal with the lack of homogeneity in the unit of observation for tax records. Equal-split series can be split income and wealth within the couple (narrow equal-split) or within the household (broad equal-split). For now, DINA series have relied on narrow equal-split measures in countries that primarily rely on tax microdata (France, United States), and broad equal-split in countries that rely more heavily on surveys (China). This should be kept in mind when making comparisons between countries. Moving forward, whenever the data allow, researchers should try to provide both series.

Equivalence scales

The DINA project does not use equivalence scales for two reasons. The first one is practical. Equivalence scales introduces nonlinearities that make it harder to connect aggregate levels of income and wealth with their distribution. If equivalized income is attributed to each individual, then the sum of all incomes across all individuals no longer sums up to aggregate income. Equivalence scales therefore prevent from cleanly breaking down national income and its growth across population groups. In WID’s view, it negatively impacts the readability and ease of use of indicators, and somewhat defeats the purpose of connecting micro and macroeconomic estimates in the first place. The second reason is conceptual. The primary aim of DINA is to measure income, wealth and their distribution. In contrast, equivalence scales are meant to approximate an individual “welfare” concept. While this distribution of “welfare” is related to income and wealth, it also incorporates many other dimensions that are outside of the project’s scope. Indeed, the DINA project does not explicitly attempt to measure how well the income of individuals suits their needs — which depend not only on their household’s size, but also on their location, their tastes, their health status, etc., all of which are partly endogenous to distribution of income and wealth themselves.

Price index

WID uses the GDP deflator as its preferred price index, following Piketty and Zucman (2014), although it resorts to the CPI when no other data is available. WID calls it the national income price index, and use it to deflate all the monetary series. Over long periods of time, comparing quantities that are independent of the price level (wealth/income ratios, share) can be more informative. Comparing income or wealth levels between time periods that are centuries apart is fraught with conceptual difficulties, and it could be argued that such comparisons do not always make sense. While WID provides some price indexes over very long time periods for convenience, users should be aware of these issues.

Purchasing power parities

Though a large number of indicators provided by the WID (such as the share of income received by various groups) are not sensitive to the overall price level, WID provides purchasing power parities (PPPs) to convert the local currency units provided by default in averages and thresholds. This dataset uses 2017 PPPs to account for inflation and for differences in the cost of living between countries. Regional aggregations provided by WID are by default using PPPs and also include market exchange rates conversions, but they are dropped for this dataset.

Measures of the distribution

In WID’s view, to focus on a single indicator — for example the well-known Gini coefficient — is not sufficient to provide an adequate picture of inequality. WID stresses that the problem is not specifically about the Gini, or about any other indicator. The problem is that inequality cannot be reduced to a single number. This is why they prefer to describe distributions in their entirety, and then let users use whatever level of detail and whatever indicator suits their needs. In terms of presenting the results, WID favors showing the income shares of three main groups (the bottom 50%, the middle 40% and the top 10%). These three groups map relatively well to the idea of a lower, middle and upper class. They summarize changes happening to the overall distribution fairly well. In practice, synthetic indicators can be approximated quite precisely by a weighted average of these three shares. WID also emphasizes using the very top groups (top 1%, top 0.1%, etc.) since they can represent a macroeconomically significant share of income and wealth. Gini coefficients are provided in the database as a convenience but encourage users to look further. WID provides distributional data by generating synthetic microfiles (synthetic microdata representative of the distribution of income and wealth for the entire population) and summarizing it in generalized percentiles, which are series with thresholds, averages and shares for 127 fractiles:

•	99 percentiles from p = 0% to p = 99%,
•	9 tenths of a percentile from p = 99% to p = 99.9%,
•	9 hundredths of a percentile from p = 99.9% to p = 99.99%,
•	10 thousandths of a percentile from p = 99.99% to p = 100%.

INCOME CONCEPTS
Income series

DINA income series distribute the entirety of net national income using concepts that are consistent with the SNA. Therefore, they include certain types of income (like the undistributed profits of corporations or indirect taxes) that are traditionally overlooked by other sources.
WID defines four broad types of series:
•	Pretax factor corresponds to the distribution of income before any redistribution, be it through social insurance systems of social assistance.
•	Pretax post-replacement income (often referred to as “pretax income”) includes redistribution that occurs through social insurance schemes (pension and sometimes unemployment benefits), but not social assistance. The main difference with pretax factor income and is the treatment of pensions, which are counted on a contribution basis by pretax factor income and on a distribution basis by pretax national income. The key reason “pretax national income” series is preferred is that it is less sensitive than pretax factor income inequality to the age structure of the population.
•	Post-tax disposable income includes all cash redistribution through the tax and transfer system, but does not include in-kind benefits and therefore does not add up to national income.
•	Finally, post-tax national income redistributes all in-kind transfers (i.e., government consumption expenditures) to individuals.

Undistributed profits

The undistributed profits of corporations are distributed to the shareholders of these corporations. Direct taxes and benefits are distributed to the people that pay the tax or receive the benefit. The corporate tax is paid by the shareholders. Sales taxes and VATs are distributed proportionally to factor income for pretax concepts, and are removed proportionally to consumption in post-tax concepts.

In-kind transfers

For in-kind transfers, three variants are considered: allocation proportional to post-tax disposable income, lump-sum allocation, and proportional allocation except for health spending which we distribute lump sum. That last concept is used as WID’s benchmark for post-tax national income.

INCOME DISTRIBUTION METHODS
When there is exhaustive tax microdata

Preferably, to compute income DINA, WID constructs microfiles that combine information from both tax and survey data. In countries with sufficiently exhaustive tax microdata, they only start from these files, and use survey data to add information about non-filers and certain tax-exempt incomes. To produce a representative dataset, WID recommends using population statistics to impute observations along characteristics such as age, marital status, gender and possibly region of residence. This is important as certain population groups may not be represented equally in income tax statistics (pensioners and young persons: small taxable incomes).

When tax data is limited
In countries where the tax data is too limited (because they only provide tax tabulations or because the informal sector is too large), WID uses the tax data to correct the surveys at the top using the approach of Blanchet, Flores, and Morgan (2019). The motive for doing so is that surveys tend to underrepresent high incomes as compared to what appears in register data. This is even more true when the survey has not been matched to administrative records (e.g., social security data on wages). The arbitrary brackets used in tax tabulations are interpolated using the generalized Pareto interpolation method, known as gpinter, which allows the distribution to have a flexible form.
The method to incorporate tax information into surveys has three stages:
•	The choice of the merging point: the highest income where the ratio of the density functions of both survey and tax records coincides with the respective ratio of cumulative density functions.
•	The reweighting of survey observations above and below this point: below are uniformly reweighted (assuming relative probability of response constant over this part of the distribution)
•	The expansion of the survey’s support by including the highest incomes from tax data: after the merging point the survey distribution is replaced by the tax distribution

Finally, income components are rescaled to SNA aggregates. Several levels of aggregation may be used depending on the quality and the precision of the data.

•	Pretax post-replacement income (often referred to as “pretax income”) includes redistribution that occurs through social insurance schemes (pension and sometimes unemployment benefits), but not social assistance. The main difference with pretax factor income and is the treatment of pensions, which are counted on a contribution basis by pretax factor income and on a distribution basis by pretax national income. The key reason “pretax national income” series is preferred is that it is less sensitive than pretax factor income inequality to the age structure of the population.
•	Post-tax disposable income includes all cash redistribution through the tax and transfer system, but does not include in-kind benefits and therefore does not add up to national income.
•	Finally, post-tax national income redistributes all in-kind transfers (i.e., government consumption expenditures) to individuals.

Undistributed profits

The undistributed profits of corporations are distributed to the shareholders of these corporations. Direct taxes and benefits are distributed to the people that pay the tax or receive the benefit. The corporate tax is paid by the shareholders. Sales taxes and VATs are distributed proportionally to factor income for pretax concepts, and are removed proportionally to consumption in post-tax concepts.

In-kind transfers

For in-kind transfers, three variants are considered: allocation proportional to post-tax disposable income, lump-sum allocation, and proportional allocation except for health spending which we distribute lump sum. That last concept is used as WID’s benchmark for post-tax national income.

In countries where the tax data is too limited (because they only provide tax tabulations or because the informal sector is too large), WID uses the tax data to correct the surveys at the top using the approach of Blanchet, Flores, and Morgan (2019). The motive for doing so is that surveys tend to underrepresent high incomes as compared to what appears in register data. This is even more true when the survey has not been matched to administrative records (e.g., social security data on wages). The arbitrary brackets used in tax tabulations are interpolated using the generalized Pareto interpolation method, known as gpinter, which allows the distribution to have a flexible form.
The method to incorporate tax information into surveys has three stages:
•	The choice of the merging point: the highest income where the ratio of the density functions of both survey and tax records coincides with the respective ratio of cumulative density functions.
•	The reweighting of survey observations above and below this point: below are uniformly reweighted (assuming relative probability of response constant over this part of the distribution)
•	The expansion of the survey’s support by including the highest incomes from tax data: after the merging point the survey distribution is replaced by the tax distribution

Finally, income components are rescaled to SNA aggregates. Several levels of aggregation may be used depending on the quality and the precision of the data.

The main research instrument of the project is a representative comparative social survey conducted globally every five years.

In the Our World in Data dataset we calculate national totals for the following questions:
<ul>
  <li>Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you need to be very careful in dealing with people?</li>
  <li>Could you tell me whether you trust people from you meet for the first time completely, somewhat, not very much or not at all?</li>
  <li>Could you tell me whether you trust people you know personally completely, somewhat, not very much or not at all?</li>
  <li>Could you tell me how much confidence you have in the government? Is it a great deal of confidence, quite a lot of confidence, not very much confidence or none at all?</li>
  <li>Do you think most people try to take advantage of you?</li>
