PIK (Potsdam-Instituts f√ºr Klimafolgenforschung) is an institute for climate impact research 
and it provides a detailed dataset of the greenhouse gas emissions from 1750. This dataset is
updated around twice a year and it is built from multiple data sources such as CDIAC, EDGAR or
FAOSTAT. The current version we use can be found at [this page](https://zenodo.org/records/10006301), 
if this is the first time you work on this dataset make sure to read 
[this page](https://zenodo.org/records/10006301) before working it. The other versions 
can be found on [this Github repo](https://github.com/JGuetschow/PRIMAP-hist).
